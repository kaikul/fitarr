  <h1>Privacy Policy for Fitarr</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-06-11</p>

  <p>Fitarr is an open-source fitness tracking application created to empower individuals to manage their own health and wellness data independently. This project is maintained by contributors and is distributed freely under an open-source license.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Fitarr does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers. All data entered into the app remains on the user’s device or server.</p>

  <h2>2. User-Controlled Integrations</h2>
  <p>If you choose to connect third-party services (e.g., Garmin, Apple Health, Fitbit), all data fetched via these integrations is handled locally and privately on your own system. We do not access or share any integration data.</p>

  <h2>3. No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
  <p>This application contains no embedded analytics, tracking pixels, or telemetry. We do not monitor usage, user behavior, or system performance.</p>

  <h2>4. Your Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Because Fitarr is self-hosted, the responsibility for data security, storage, and backups lies with the user or the entity hosting the application.</p>

  <h2>5. Open Source Nature</h2>
  <p>This application is provided as-is, without warranty. Developers and maintainers take no responsibility for how the software is used or hosted. Review the code and configure integrations responsibly.</p>
